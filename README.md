# bin_packing_swift


## Packing all the things

Bin packing app for swift. Why, you ask? Because I want to elarn to be swifty.

So I started this commandline application template by calling 

```bash
swift package init --type executable
```

I first had to run 
```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
```
to make it work. I think its because I installed the Xcode commandline tools before I installed the Xcode main application.
